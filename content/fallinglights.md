                <p>Falling Lights is a cute microgame where you play as a little bear that has to avoid the falling stars. It also features a decently sized Skin Store.</p>
                <p>This game allowed me to <b>release a game into Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store</b>, while also giving me ton's of experience in the implementation of their respective SDKs and the game's integration with Firebase to keep track of users digital assets.</p>
